# Designing and implementing systems for real mobile robots and simulator


This project centers on designing and implementing systems for real mobile robots using a simulator. It encompasses the implementation of a PID controller for right edge following behavior and a fuzzy logic controller for both right edge following behavior and obstacle avoidance behavior. These behaviors are then integrated into a single fuzzy logic control architecture, empowering the robot to navigate by following edges and avoiding obstacles effectively.
